# Nuggets of NUS Project READMe
## Project Scope

A Food delivery app for NUS students. 

We hope to make the process of getting delivered food cheap and accessible to all NUS residents given their busy schedules while also providing opportunities to NUS students to make some extra allowance by delivering food for their peers. As such, NUS students can choose to use the app to order food or to help takeaway food for other students.

### Level of Achievement: Apollo 

## Problem Motivation
We discovered that NUS students, especially those staying on campus, are ‌too busy or too lazy to travel to buy food. Hence, we would like to provide a solution that enables these students to get food delivered to them at their convenience without breaking the bank. Furthermore,  we believe that there are many students like ourselves who are willing to takeaway food for others if they are incentivized to do so. Thus, students who opt to deliver food will also be rewarded accordingly through a delivery fee, thus providing them with extra allowance.


## Core Features
This Mobile App provides a platform for both Users and Deliverers. On the interface for ordering,  the user can select their food and place their orders. It also contains the menus and prices of the various eateries on and around campus to ensure students have a wide variety to pick from. On the interface for delivering, students can select orders that they are willing to accept. Below is a detailed list of the core features we intend to implement as of now for the app to be a minimum viable product: 

1. Registration and Login (Set-up): Users have to register their accounts on the app in order to access the app features.
1. Home screen (Core): Users can access a list of eateries in NUS and clicking on shows a list of food options. 
1. Ordering Screen (Core): Users can proceed to place their orders by selecting the item on the menu and specifying their quantity before ordering it.
1. ‘My Orders’ Screen (Core): Users can view placed orders or delete an order.
1. ‘My Deliveries’ Screen (Core): Users can view all available orders to accept and once accepted, it will appear under my accepted deliveries and can carry out deliveries from here. Once delivered, deliverers can complete the delivery to delete it.
1. Status of Order/Delivery (Core): Users can view status of order (accepted/not accepted) from both Orders and Deliveries screen
1. My Profile (Core): Users can view your own account of your profile to verify identity.

Below are a list of additional features to improve user experience for both Users and Deliverers:

1. ‘Edit’ Functions: Edit Orders and edit profile functions
1. Stalls Screen: Include individual canteen stalls and their menus
1. Restaurant Map View: Map function to show ordering location and how far delivery is.
1. Delivery Fee by Distance:  As the restuarants distance can now be determined, the delivery fee should now be able to vary based on distance from order location. 
1. Search engine: Users can search for type of food or canteen in a search bar
1. Ratings: Users can also rate the service of the deliverer after every delivery.
